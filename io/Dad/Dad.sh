# Dad — a Reflector issue: the ERC-20 named "Dad" minted by
# USDCReflector.issue("Dad", variant). USDCReflector is the Reflector
# clone pegged to chain-local Circle USDC; it issues through its coinage
# (the Lepton prototype), so this is a Lepton clone whose maker is the
# USDCReflector clone and whose symbol/decimals/supply are fixed by
# Reflector for a USDC peg. The same prediction holds on every chain.
